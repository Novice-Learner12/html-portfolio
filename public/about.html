<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiastic learner who likes to explore around. Throughout my childhood, I have always been interested in public
  speaking events. This would not have happened if my dad did not push me forward, and I am really grateful he encouraged me.
  Since that first competition in Grade 4, I have been able to get first rank in most speech and debating events because my dad 
  helped me. I was no longer nervous to speak at public events and later on I grasped a lot of opportunities. Like, for 
  example, the MC of my high school events, an MUN organizing committee member, and the Director General. Similarly, I was also given an 
  opportunity to be an MC for a very high-profile college event, and my professor thanked me because I opened this path for 
  students to be an MC.

<p>Despite my public speaking events and opportunities, I am a very introverted person. I do like to do things at my own pace.
  However, since I left home to embark on my journey to higher education, I have had to socialize with others because now I am 
  alone in a different country. Although I am still shy, I do interact with others more openly than before.

<p>I love watching anime and Chinese and Japanese dramas. If I were to tell someone I never really watched English movies or 
  series for a while, then you would not believe me at all. Ask me if I have watched this movie or series, and my answer would
  probably be a no because I watched other things. Even more than watching, I loved listening to music and trying to create
  poems or stories based on my imagination. Although, these days I have started watching some popular movies ,like, for 
  example, "Pirates of the Caribbean," Marvel, Underworld, Jurassic Park, etc.
